Access -- find access group(s)

p4 access <read|write> path[revRange]

    BETA This command attempts to find the correct group for you to get access to an area and tell you who to contact.

    With the path, be as specific with the path as possible, it will give you better results.

    For example:

        p4 access read //path/to/some/file/MAIN/...
        
    Will find the best group(s) to give read access to //path/to/some/file/MAIN/...

    This is a work in progress, please contact support if it doesn't work as expected."
